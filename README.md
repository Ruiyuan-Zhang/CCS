# Co-creation Space - Code Release

## Introduction

We are excited to announce that our paper, titled "Scalable Geometric Fracture Assembly via Co-creation Space among Assemblers", has been accepted by the AAAI 2024. In line with our commitment to open science and reproducible research, we are preparing to release the code associated with our findings. `Co-creation Space`(CSS) is based on [Multi-Part Shape Assembly](https://github.com/Wuziyi616/multi_part_assembly).

## Code Release Plan

Our code release will be structured in the following phases to ensure quality and ease of use:

1. **Core Code Organization**: We will first release the core algorithms and models that form the backbone of our research. This will include the primary scripts and modules necessary to understand and replicate the key results presented in our paper.

2. **Checkpoint Release**: Following the core code, we will provide pre-trained models or checkpoints. These will enable users to quickly reproduce our results without the need for extensive training.

3. **Documentation and Usage Instructions**: To facilitate the use of our code and models, comprehensive documentation will be provided. This will include detailed instructions on how to set up the environment, run the code, and replicate our experiments.

## Estimated Timeline

We are currently in the process of preparing the code for release. While we cannot provide an exact release date at this moment, we are targeting to complete the release process in the following order:

- Core Code: [Estimated 19/12/2023]
- Checkpoints: [Estimated 25/12/2023]
- Documentation: [Estimated 30/12/2023]
